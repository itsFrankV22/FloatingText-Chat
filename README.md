# FloatingText-Chat
Tshock Plugin: Shows Floating texts above players when they send a message in chat


> [!NOTE]
> This is a beta, I'm currently learning to program so I can't guarantee it's totally perfect, but it works in Tshock V5


**To install the plugin on your TShock server, follow these steps:**

1. **Download the Release:**
   - Go to the [Releases]([https://github.com/tuusuario/tu-repositorio/releases](https://github.com/itsFrankV22/FloatingText-Chat/releases/tag/FloatingText)) section of this repository on GitHub.
   - Search for the latest release available.
   - Download the `.zip` or `.dll` file corresponding to your version of TShock.

2. **Add the Plugin to TShock:**
   - Extract the `.zip` file if you downloaded a compressed version.
   - Copy the `.dll` file of the extracted plugin.
   - Navigate to your TShock server folder. This folder is usually located in `TShock/ServerPlugins` within the directory where you installed TShock.
   - Paste the `.dll` file into the `ServerPlugins` folder.

3. **Restart the Server:**
   - Restart your TShock server to load the new plugin.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Once the server has restarted, you can verify that the plugin has loaded correctly by checking the messages in the server console or by using the `/plugins` command in the game.
